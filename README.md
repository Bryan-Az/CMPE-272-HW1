This is the code used for creating a network between 3 VM instances. The main server works as a proxy and will route its' IP to the other two servers (web-server-a and web-server-b). These two servers will loadbalance the traffic from the main server and will respond to web requests with HTML that outputs the name of the server responsible for handling the request. There is a video demo in this repo. The install_loadbalancing_proxy.sh bash script should be run on the main server. The haproxy.cfg file is created during the execution, and I included it for clarity. The install_webserver_x.sh files should be ran on the respective loadbalancing/back-end servers. I also included a pdf to document the process.
